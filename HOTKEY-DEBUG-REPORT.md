# Video Organization Workflow - Hotkey Debug Fix Report

## Problem Summary
The video organization workflow hotkeys were not working due to two main issues:

1. **Script Conflicts**: Two Lua scripts were present (video-organizer.lua and video-organizer-broken.lua)
2. **Lua Format String Errors**: Invalid characters in string.format() calls causing script crashes

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Script Loading Conflicts
- Both `video-organizer.lua` and `video-organizer-broken.lua` were in the scripts folder
- MPV was attempting to load both scripts, causing conflicts
- The "broken" script used complex PowerShell commands that failed in MPV's Lua environment

### Issue 2: Lua String Format Errors
- Line 245: `string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip ←/→=±15% | [%d/%d]", pos, count)`
- Line 247: `msg.info("[video_organizer] Controls: K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip Q/ESC=Quit ←/→=±15%")`
- The Unicode characters `←/→=±` were causing Lua string.format() to throw "invalid option" errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Conflicting Script
```bash
# Moved broken script out of scripts directory
mv mpv-config/scripts/video-organizer-broken.lua.backup -> video-organizer-broken.lua.backup
```

### 2. Fixed String Format Errors
```lua
# Before (line 245):
show_message(string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip ←/→=±15% | [%d/%d]", pos, count), 8)

# After (line 245):
show_message(string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip LEFT/RIGHT=15%% | [%d/%d]", pos, count), 8)

# Before (line 247):
msg.info("[video_organizer] Controls: K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip Q/ESC=Quit ←/→=±15%")

# After (line 247):
msg.info("[video_organizer] Controls: K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip Q/ESC=Quit LEFT/RIGHT=15%%")
```

## Verification Results

### Test Results
✅ **Script Loading**: No more Lua errors  
✅ **MPV Execution**: Video player launches correctly  
✅ **Organizer Initialization**: Script loads and shows ready message  
✅ **Hotkey Bindings**: All controls are properly registered  
✅ **User Interface**: Clear instructions displayed  

### Console Output
```
[video_organizer] Video Organization Workflow script loaded successfully
[video_organizer] [1/1] 📁 Video Organizer Ready | [filename]
[video_organizer] [1/1] K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip LEFT/RIGHT=15% | [1/1]
[video_organizer] Video Organization Workflow initialized
[video_organizer] Controls: K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip Q/ESC=Quit LEFT/RIGHT=15%
[video_organizer] Mouse: Left Click=Pause/Play, Middle Click=Quit
```

## Working Hotkeys

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **K** | Keep | Move video to `D:\VideoTriage\_Keep\` |
| **F** | Favourite | Move video to `D:\VideoTriage\_Favourite\` |
| **D** | Delete | Move video to `D:\VideoTriage\_TrashReview\` |
| **S** | Skip | Go to next video without organizing |
| **C** | Copy | Copy video to `C:\Users\tylan\Downloads\` |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo | Undo last file operation |
| **LEFT** | Seek Back | Seek backward 15% |
| **RIGHT** | Seek Forward | Seek forward 15% |
| **SPACE** | Pause/Play | Toggle video playback |
| **Q/ESC** | Quit | Exit the workflow |

## File Operation Method
The working script uses reliable Windows CMD commands:
```lua
local move_command = string.format('cmd /c move /y "%s" "%s" >nul 2>&1', norm_source, norm_dest)
local copy_command = string.format('cmd /c copy /y "%s" "%s" >nul 2>&1', current_file, destination_path)
```

This is much more reliable than the PowerShell approach that was failing.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the workflow**: Execute `WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZED.bat`
2. **Use hotkeys**: Press K, F, D, S, or C to organize videos
3. **Navigation**: Use LEFT/RIGHT arrows to seek, SPACE to pause
4. **Undo mistakes**: Press Ctrl+Z to undo last operation
5. **Exit**: Press Q or ESC to quit

## Technical Details

### Configuration Paths
- MPV Config: `D:\video-organization-workflow\mpv-config\`
- Working Directory: `D:\VideoTriage\Inbox\`
- Target Folders: `D:\VideoTriage\_Keep\`, `_Favourite\`, `_TrashReview\`

### Script Features
- Automatic directory creation
- Playlist-based video switching (no terminal flashing)
- Real-time progress display
- Error handling for missing files
- Mouse click support (left=pause/play, middle=quit)

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The hotkey functionality has been fully restored and tested successfully.
