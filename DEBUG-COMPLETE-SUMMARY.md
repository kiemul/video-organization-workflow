# 🎉 VIDEO ORGANIZATION WORKFLOW - HOTKEY DEBUG COMPLETE ✅

## SUMMARY
**Status: FULLY RESOLVED AND WORKING**

Your video organization workflow hotkeys have been successfully debugged and fixed! All functionality is now working correctly.

## THE PROBLEM
The hotkeys (K, F, D, S, C, Ctrl+Z) were not working due to two critical issues:

1. **Script Conflicts**: Two competing Lua scripts were causing interference
2. **Lua Syntax Errors**: Invalid Unicode characters in string formatting

## THE SOLUTION
✅ **Removed conflicting script** - Moved `video-organizer-broken.lua` out of the scripts folder  
✅ **Fixed Lua format errors** - Replaced problematic Unicode characters with standard ASCII  
✅ **Verified all hotkeys work** - Tested and confirmed full functionality  

## WORKING HOTKEYS (VERIFIED)

| Hotkey | Action | Destination |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **K** | Keep | `D:\VideoTriage\_Keep\` |
| **F** | Favourite | `D:\VideoTriage\_Favourite\` |
| **D** | Delete | `D:\VideoTriage\_TrashReview\` |
| **S** | Skip | Next video (no move) |
| **C** | Copy | `C:\Users\tylan\Downloads\` |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo | Reverse last operation |
| **LEFT/RIGHT** | Seek | ±15% video position |
| **SPACE** | Pause/Play | Toggle playback |
| **Q/ESC** | Quit | Exit workflow |

## MOUSE CONTROLS
- **Left Click**: Pause/Play video
- **Middle Click**: Quit workflow

## HOW TO USE

```bash
D:\video-organization-workflow\WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZED.bat

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Fixed Code Examples
```lua
# BEFORE (causing errors):
string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip ←/→=±15% | [%d/%d]", pos, count)

# AFTER (working):
string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip LEFT/RIGHT=15%% | [%d/%d]", pos, count)
```

### File Operations
The script uses reliable Windows CMD commands:
```lua
-- Move files
cmd /c move /y "source" "destination" >nul 2>&1

-- Copy files  
cmd /c copy /y "source" "destination" >nul 2>&1
```
