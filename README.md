## 🚀 Usage

### Launch Options
```cmd
# Recommended (with debug documentation)
D:\video-organization-workflow\WORKFLOW-VERIFIED.bat

# Original (also working)
D:\video-organization-workflow\WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZED.bat

# Testing (single video validation)
D:\video-organization-workflow\TEST-HOTKEYS.bat
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
D:\VideoTriage\
├── Inbox\          # Place new videos here for processing
├── _Keep\          # Videos to retain
├── _Favourite\     # High-value videos  
└── _TrashReview\   # Videos marked for deletion
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fixed Lua Script Issues
```lua
# BEFORE (causing errors):
string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip ←/→=±15% | [%d/%d]", pos, count)

# AFTER (working):
string.format("K=Keep F=Favourite D=Delete S=Skip LEFT/RIGHT=15%% | [%d/%d]", pos, count)
```

### File Operations
The working script uses reliable Windows CMD commands:
```lua
-- Move files
local move_command = string.format('cmd /c move /y "%s" "%s" >nul 2>&1', norm_source, norm_dest)

-- Copy files  
local copy_command = string.format('cmd /c copy /y "%s" "%s" >nul 2>&1', current_file, destination_path)
```
